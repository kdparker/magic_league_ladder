Magic League Ladder
===================

A django project to create a ladder system for the MTG league run in our house.
Being morphed in to a more generalised format: https://github.com/kdparker/web_ladder
The magic version is being kept here since I just don't want to deal with changing anything with already existing data if I don't have to.

Project is hosted on heroku at: http://erbmagicleague.herokuapp.com/
